# Cache-aside sample implementation

This console app was created to test the Redis Cache for implementing the Cache-aside Cloud Design Pattern.

Thanks to [Barry Luijbregts](https://github.com/bmaluijb) for creating such inspiring Pluralsight courses that pushed me to starting creating samples like this to help the community.

Please see the implementations he did for explaining each Cloud Design Pattern [here](https://github.com/bmaluijb/CloudDesignPatterns).

## Technologies used

### .NET Core 2.0

A .NET Core console application to get information about a Sticker Album. You can _Query data_ to get information about a specific sticker by its number.

### FluentMigrator 

Used to setup the database schema. See class [AddStickerTable.cs](src/console/AddStickerTable.cs).

### Entity Framework Core

Used to query data from the database

### Redis Cache

The cache technology used to implement this sample.

## Prepare for running

### Running the ARM Template

Before starting to run the console app, you need to provision the cloud infrastructure needed to run this application. Take a look at the [ARM Template](src/armtemplate/Readme.md) for more information.

### Insert some data into the database

You might need to add some data to the Stickers table before starting. The table schema looks like below. I would add some data like this:

|Id|Number|PlayerName|Country|
|--|------|----------|-------|
|1|370|Gabriel Jesus|Brazil|
|2|371|Neymar Jr.|Brazil|

Tip: use the [Query Editor (Preview)](https://azure.microsoft.com/pt-br/blog/t-sql-query-editor-in-browser-azure-portal/) to make things easier.

### Update the appsettings.json with connection strings

The last step before running this sample is to update [appsettings.json](src/console/appsettings.json) with your connection strings for both the Azure SQL Database and the Redis Cache. To take these info from these workloads, take a look at the documentation below:

* [Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-connect-query-dotnet-visual-studio#for-adonet)
* [Azure Redis Cache](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/azure/redis-cache/cache-dotnet-how-to-use-azure-redis-cache#retrieve-host-name-ports-and-access-keys-using-the-azure-portal)

**Attention!** Take a look at the default username and password for the SQL Server. You're going to need it in your connection string. Change it on [template.json](src/armtemplate/template.json) if you want to, before running the Azure Deployment.

## Running the sample

On the _console_ folder, `dotnet restore` and then `dotnet run` and voil√°! You'll see the following options:

```
1 - Query data.
2 - Remove from cache.
X - Exit.
```

### Getting the cache insight

When running the app, first **Query Data**. You'll be asked about the sticker number you want to query. Type it and check the results. You're going to get something like this:

```
-------
Found the following sticker:
-------
Number: {sticker.Number}
Player: {sticker.PlayerName}
Country: {sticker.Country}
Source: {source}
Execution time: {executionTime}ms
-------
```

Special attention to the last two lines. For the first time, the data will come from the SQL Server. Keep in mind the execution time.

Now query for the same sticker number. You'll notice that the source will become Redis Cache and... Take a look at the execution time. Repeat the query to see the results.

To reset the data from the cache, use the option _2 - Remove from cache_.
